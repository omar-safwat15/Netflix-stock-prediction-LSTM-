# Netflix Stock Prediction LSTM

This repository contains code for predicting the stock prices of Netflix using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using LSTM neural networks to forecast the stock prices of Netflix. The LSTM architecture is well-suited for capturing and learning patterns in time series data, making it a popular choice for stock price prediction tasks.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow (version 2.x)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/omar-safwat15/Netflix-stock-prediction-LSTM-.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd Netflix-stock-prediction-LSTM-


3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook


4. Open the Netflix Stock Prediction.ipynb notebook.

5. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to train the LSTM model and make stock price predictions.
